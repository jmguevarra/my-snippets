<h2>File Download Check</h2>

To serve you the file you have requested, we'd like to make sure that you are human. Kindly take the test below.
<br /><br />


<form action="http://www.rexegg.com/dl/2-check.php?f=pcre2test-1034.zip&amp;fc=" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <div class="captcha_wrapper">
		<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6Lc2WE8UAAAAABFS5ks4OB6onjL6EJOP_kDE7zTZ"></div>
	</div>
	<button type="submit" id="submit">Click to Download!</button>
</form>


<br />
<h2>Why this check?</h2>
Believe it or not, on the internet, much of the traffic to websites is not by humans but by "robots" that automatically read web pages and download everything in their path. Sometimes, this is a good thing: for instance, the Google crawler that indexes files is a robot. But, all too often, the robots are programs that serve no public purpose.<br /><br />
Every time a file is downloaded, it costs me money. Not very much, but it adds up. So, for larger files, I try to check that the downloader is not a robot.<br /><br />
Hope this answers your question!<br /><br />
Smiles, <br /><br />
Andy
